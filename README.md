This repository contains some useful scripts that are designed to do small tasks such as:
- Parsing the output of a tool to make it easier to read.
- Cleaning up a file so that it can be processed by a tool.
- Collecting various kinds of data from multiple sources.

Check out the [YAML files](bash) or [scripts.md](scripts.md) for a complete list.
